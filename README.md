# Ascii-Art-Generator
## Project Description
ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a common encoding format used for representing strings and text data in computers.
Butâ€¦what if we use this for something other than text? Like for example Asciifying an image or a video. In this project we'll be seeing how we can form an ascii art version of an image and a video. 
## How to run the project
* you can choose Download Zip option in the dropdown of 'code' just above the files or can use git clone command to download the contents of the project.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/devanshmishra10/Ascii-Art-Generator
```
* Once you have the folder and the files in your system open the sketch.py and video.py files in your editor and run the python file one by one.
```
> python sketch.py
```
```
> python video.py
```
> Note : above command maybe different according to the version of python installed in your system so check it accordingly like using python3 command instead of python.
* The video.py file supports Windows OS only in order to show the asciified video so make sure you run this file in Windows only to get no error. 
* You can change the input image and video files by adding your files in the 'data' folder and changing the name of the file in the code file accordingly.
## The internal working of the project


## My learnings from the project


## Description of my tasks
Here in this project these two are the tasks which I'm performing :
* Taking any image as an input and forming a pencil sketched version of the image but only with ascii characters embedded in it.
* Taking any video and displaying its asciified version on a screen.
